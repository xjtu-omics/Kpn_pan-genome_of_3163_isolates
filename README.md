# Kpn Pan-Genome Analysis of 3,163 Isolates

This repository contains scripts, trained models, plotting utilities, and necessary related data for a pan-genome-based analysis of 3,163 *Klebsiella pneumoniae* isolates. The workflow covers pan-genome construction, feature extraction, feature selection, candidate determination, model training, downstream analysis, and figure generation. AMR phenotypes used in this workflow and some analysis outputs generated from this study are also included here.

## Directory Guide

The repository is organized by analysis stage, so each top-level directory represents one major part of the pipeline.

| Directory type | Directory | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Code | `Pan-genome_construction/` | Builds and post-processes the pan-genome, including genome annotation, Panaroo execution, GFF updates, AMR annotation, and gene cluster cleaning of pan-genome outputs. |
| Code | `Feature_extraction/` | Identifies core-gene variants through single-base-resolution alignment, annotates variants with snpEff, retains non-synonymous variants, and encodes them together with dispensable gene presence/absence into binary feature matrices. |
| Code | `Feature_selection/` | Screens the full feature set using statistical tests and ranks features based on machine-learning-derived importance scores. |
| Code | `Candidates_determine_and_model_train/` | Determines candidate features, prepares selected feature matrices, trains models, tests and validates performance, and saves model artifacts. |
| Code | `Further_analyzation/` | Performs downstream biological analyses, including candidate-feature prioritization and transposon-associated genomic pattern analysis. |
| Code | `Plot/` | Contains scripts for generating main and supplementary figures. |
| Input Data | `AMR_phenotypes/` | Contains AMR phenotype data for HuiNet isolates (with GN-prefixed sample IDs) and PATRIC isolates (with GC-prefixed sample IDs); some PATRIC phenotypes are not available in the source database. |
| Intermediate files | `Candidate_feature_matrices/` | Selected candidate feature matrices for model training, testing and validation. |
| Result | `Trained_models/` | Trained model files for 17 antimicrobial phenotypes. |
| Result | `Gene_seqs_of_candidates/` | DNA sequences and translated protein sequences of the longCentroids of each candidate gene cluster. |

## Code Guide

Usage documentation for each script is provided in the README file in the same folder.
