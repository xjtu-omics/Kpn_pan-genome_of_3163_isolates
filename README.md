# Kpn Pan-Genome Analysis of 3,163 Isolates

(Draft version; still under revision)
剩余任务：1.准确化workflow 2.给每个代码文件写说明，让人看懂怎么用

This repository contains scripts, trained models, and plotting utilities for a pan-genome-based analysis of 3,163 *Klebsiella pneumoniae* isolates. The workflow covers pan-genome construction, feature extraction, feature selection, candidate determination, model training, downstream analysis, and figure generation.

Usage documentation for each script will be provided in the README file in the same folder.

## Directory Guide

The repository is organized by analysis stage, so each top-level directory represents one major part of the pipeline.

| Directory | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `Pan-genome_construction/` | Builds and post-processes the pan-genome, including genome annotation, Panaroo execution, GFF updates, AMR annotation, and gene cluster cleaning of pan-genome outputs. |
| `Feature_extraction/` | Identifies core-gene variants through single-base-resolution alignment, annotates variants with snpEff, retains non-synonymous variants, and encodes them together with dispensable gene presence/absence into binary feature matrices. |
| `Feature_selection/` | Screens the full feature set using statistical tests and ranks features based on machine-learning-derived importance scores. |
| `Candidates_determine_and_model_train/` | Determines candidate features, prepares selected feature matrices, trains models, tests and validates performance, and saves model artifacts. |
| `Further_analyzation/` | Performs downstream biological analyses, including candidate-feature prioritization and transposon-associated genomic pattern analysis. |
| `Plot/` | Contains scripts for generating main and supplementary figures. |
| `Trained_models/` | Stores serialized trained model artifacts for 17 antimicrobial phenotypes. |
