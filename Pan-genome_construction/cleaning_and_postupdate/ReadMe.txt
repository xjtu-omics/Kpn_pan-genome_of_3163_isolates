Pan-genome cleaning and post-update scripts
==========================================

This folder contains scripts used after Panaroo to clean MSA files, identify
problematic gene clusters, classify genes by prevalence, and build a
gene-by-sample contig matrix.

Recommended workflow
--------------------

1. Remove gap or non-ATCG characters from aligned gene sequences if needed.
2. Summarize MSA length distributions.
3. Filter gene clusters with serious reference/mode length differences.
4. Move invalid MSA files out of the analysis set.
5. Remove remaining length outlier contigs.
6. Classify cleaned genes as core, dispensable, or rare.

Scripts
-------

remove-.py
    Purpose:
        Remove non-ATCG characters, including alignment gap characters, from
        FASTA/MSA sequences.
    Main input:
        ./both-align-results-strict-adv/aligned_gene_sequences/
    Main output:
        ./both-align-results-strict-adv/gene_sequences/
    Usage:
        Edit input_folder and output_folder if needed, then run:

            python remove-.py

msa_contig_length_stats.py
    Purpose:
        For each MSA, calculate the modal sequence length, reference length,
        total sequence count, and number of sequences outside mode +/- 20%.
    Usage:

            python msa_contig_length_stats.py <pan_genome_reference.fa> <msa_dir> <output.tsv>

filt_serious_diff.py
    Purpose:
        Filter the MSA length summary and identify clusters where the reference
        length and modal MSA length differ by more than 100 bp and more than
        20%.
    Usage:

            python filt_serious_diff.py <msa_length_summary.tsv> <serious_diff.tsv>

move_invalid_msa.py
    Purpose:
        Move low-confidence MSA files listed in serious_diff.tsv into an
        invalid folder so that they are not used in downstream analysis.
    Usage:

            python move_invalid_msa.py <serious_diff.tsv> <msa_dir> <output_dir>

clean_msa_outliers.py
    Purpose:
        Remove contig sequences whose lengths are outside mode +/- 20% within
        each MSA and write cleaned MSA files to a new folder.
    Usage:

            python clean_msa_outliers.py <msa_dir> <output_dir>

classify_msa_by_ids.py
    Purpose:
        Classify cleaned gene-cluster MSA files by sample prevalence:
        core genes are present in more than 90% of 3,163 isolates;
        dispensable genes are present in more than 3 isolates but below the
        core threshold; rare genes are present in at most 3 isolates.
    Usage:

            python classify_msa_by_ids.py <cleaned_msa_dir> <classified_output_dir>

clean_gene_presence_absence.py
    Purpose:
        Build a gene-by-sample matrix from .fas files. Rows are genes, columns
        are samples, and each cell records the full contig/header names where
        the gene is present.
    Usage:

            python clean_gene_presence_absence.py -i <input_fas_dir> -o <gene_contig_matrix.tsv>

contig_index_transform.py
    Purpose:
        Convert contig/header identifiers in the gene-by-sample matrix using
        Panaroo gene_data.csv mappings. It builds or reuses an on-disk SQLite
        mapping database for large files.
    Usage:
        Run with --help to see all available options:

            python contig_index_transform.py --help
